## Frequently Asked Questions ❓

### How many bunkers can exist? – So many bunker!! 
Each subsequent block will grant a random amount of coins between 0 and 1 million to encourage miners to continue to
secure the network and make up for lost wallets on hard drives/phones/lost
encryption passwords/etc.


### Mining information ⛏

Bunkercoin uses a simplified variant of the scrypt key derivation function as its
proof of work with a target time of one minute per block and difficulty
readjustment after every block. The block rewards are fixed and halve every
100,000 blocks. Starting with the 600,000th block, a permanent reward of
10,000 Bunkercoin per block will be issued.

Originally, a different payout scheme was envisioned with block rewards being
determined by taking the maximum reward as per the block schedule and applying
the result of a Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number generator to arrive at a
number between 0 and the maximum reward.

**The current block reward schedule:**

| Block                | Reward in Bunkercoin |
| :------------------- | -----------------:   |
| 1–99,999             |        0–1,000,000   |
| 100,000–144,999      |          0–500,000   |
| 145,000–199,999      |            250,000   |
| 200,000–299,999      |            125,000   |
| 300,000–399,999      |             62,500   |
| 400,000–499,999      |             31,250   |
